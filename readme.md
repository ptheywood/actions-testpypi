# Actions TestPyPI

Repo for testing/prototyping github actions workflows which publish packages to (test) pypi.

This is in advance of setting this up for a real python package which will publish to real testpypi, without breaking anything related to the real package(s).

This was using the following guide from the Python Packaging User guide:
